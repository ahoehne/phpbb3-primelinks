# phpbb3-primelinks
modificated phpbb3.1.x mod from http://www.absoluteanime.com/admin/mods.htm#links

Seems to work on phpbb3.2.x aswell

modifications by www.webdesign-hoehne.de

if you don't need to modify whitelisting you probably should go for the original mod:
- phpbb3.0.x: https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/mod/prime_links/
- phpbb3.1.x: http://www.absoluteanime.com/admin/mods.htm#links


How To install:

1) Just place this Repository in your phpbb3 installation

2) You are free to rename domain_whitelist.example.php to domain_whitelist.php or create your own one

3) Modify your domain_whitelist.php to whitelist your Domains
